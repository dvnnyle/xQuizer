    "explanation": "Acceptability concerns how well technology fits into users real lives across multiple dimensions:<br><br>• <strong>Cultural acceptability</strong>: fits social norms and values<br>• <strong>Political acceptability</strong>: Trust, rights, fairness<br>• <strong>Social acceptability</strong>: Appropriate for social contexts<br>• <strong>Economic acceptability</strong>: Affordable, good value<br><br>A system can be accessible and usable but still fail if It's not acceptable to users in their real context.<br><br>Example: Google Glass failed partly due to social acceptability—people felt uncomfortable being recorded in public, making the technology socially unacceptable despite It's technical capabilities."

    "explanation": "The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) predicts technology adoption based on user perceptions:<br><br>• <strong>perceived ease of use</strong>: How easy is it to use?<br>• <strong>perceived usefulness</strong>: Does it help achieve goals?<br>• <strong>Trust</strong> (added later): Is it reliable and secure?<br><br>TAM shows that even powerful technology fails if users perceive it as difficult or not useful for their needs.<br><br>Example: Many people avoid using password managers because they perceive them as complicated (low ease of use), even though experts know they're useful for security."

    "shortExplanation": "Shackel's usability framework emphasizes ease of use, learnability, and positive user attitudes.",
    "explanation": "Shackel (1990) defined a classic framework for usability based on three core principles:<br><br>• <strong>Easy to use</strong>: System should be efficient and effective for accomplishing tasks with minimal effort<br>• <strong>Easy to learn</strong>: Users should quickly become proficient without extensive training<br>• <strong>Engender a good attitude</strong>: System should create positive feelings and user satisfaction, not frustration<br><br>This framework recognizes that usability isn't just about functionality—it's also about the emotional and attitudinal response users have toward the system. A truly usable system makes users feel confident, competent, and satisfied.<br><br>Example: A word processor that is easy to use (simple formatting tools), easy to learn (familiar icons, tooltips), and engenders good attitude (satisfying to create polished documents quickly) demonstrates Shackel's principles in action."

    "shortExplanation": "Pleasure design aims for delight and enjoyment beyond basic usability and acceptability.",
    "explanation": "While acceptability ensures technology fits into users' lives, designing for pleasure aims higher—creating experiences that are genuinely delightful and enjoyable. Jordan (2000) identified four types of pleasure in design:<br><br>• <strong>Physio-pleasure</strong>: Sensory delight from touch, sound, visual beauty (smooth animations, satisfying haptic feedback)<br>• <strong>Socio-pleasure</strong>: Enjoyment from social interaction and connection (sharing features, multiplayer experiences)<br>• <strong>Psycho-pleasure</strong>: Cognitive satisfaction from accomplishment and mastery (progress indicators, achievements)<br>• <strong>Ideo-pleasure</strong>: Values-based satisfaction from aesthetics and meaning (beautiful design, alignment with personal values)<br><br>Designing for pleasure transforms functional tools into experiences users actively enjoy, not just tolerate.<br><br>Example: Duolingo gamifies language learning with streak counters, playful animations, and encouraging messages—creating psycho-pleasure (achievement) and physio-pleasure (delightful visuals) that go far beyond a merely acceptable language app."
