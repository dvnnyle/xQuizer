    "question": "Why does the chapter describe PACT as the backbone of human-centred design?",
    "options": [
      "Because it replaces all other design methods",
      "Because it grounds design in real people, activities, contexts and technologies",
      "Because it only focuses on technology performance",

    "answer": "Because it grounds design in real people, activities, contexts and technologies",
    "explanation": "PACT ensures design is rooted in who is doing what, where, and with what tools, which is central to human-centred design.<br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Human-centred design means understanding actual users in real situations. PACT forces designers to ask: Who will use this? Doing what? Where? With what? This grounds design in reality, not assumptions.",
