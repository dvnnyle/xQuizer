    "shortExplanation": "Envisionment makes abstract ideas concrete for exploration and early evaluation.",
    "explanation": "Envisionment focuses on expressing and exploring design ideas early using representations so issues appear before heavy investment.<br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Instead of debating 'Should we add social features?' abstractly, a team sketches a profile page and sharing flow, making the idea concrete enough to discuss trade-offs and spot problems."
