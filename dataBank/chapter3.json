    "shortExplanation": "Designers first grasp the messy problem space before observing or building.",
    "explanation": "Understanding means grasping the problem space before jumping to solutions. Design problems are messy and ambiguous—stakeholders disagree, requirements conflict, and the problem evolves as you explore it.<br><br>Why understanding comes first:<br>• Problems seem simple until you dig deeper<br>• Stakeholders describe symptoms, not root causes<br>• Initial assumptions are usually wrong<br><br><strong>Example:</strong> A team designing a food delivery app discovers through user research that the real problem isn't checkout flow—it's unpredictable delivery times causing anxiety. Without understanding first, they would have optimized the wrong thing."

    "answer": "They represented different kinds of tourists and their needs",
    "explanation": "Personas in Secret City described visitors such as culture-seeking tourists and families with children.

    "answer": "iterative prototyping with personas and scenarios leads to a more engaging, human-centred product",
    "explanation": "The case study shows that combining personas, scenarios, prototypes and real-world evaluation lets designers refine the guide so it fits real tourists' needs and creates a richer experience.<br><br><strong>Example:</strong> After testing prototypes, the team discovered tourists wanted offline maps and shorter tours—feedback that led to redesigned features, proving that iteration with real users creates better products than assumptions alone.",
    "shortExplanation": "The method integrates understanding, design, and evaluation through scenarios at every stage."
