      "Consistency",
      "Constraints"
    ],
    "answerIndex": 2,
    "answer": "Consistency",
    "explanation": "Consistency means similar things should look and act the same way everywhere in your interface. When users learn how to do something once, it should work the same way in other places.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Users don't need to relearn things when everything is consistent. If things look similar but act differently, users get confused and make mistakes.<br><br><strong>Example:</strong><br>• In Microsoft Office, Ctrl+S saves your work in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint—always the same<br>• The Bold button looks identical across all apps<br>• Bad example: A Submit button on one page, but a Submit link on another page—users don't know what to expect",

    "explanation": "Visibility means users should be able to see what the system is doing and what options are available. Don't hide important things.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Hidden information forces users to remember or guess, increasing cognitive load and errors.<br><br><strong>Example:</strong><br>• Shopping cart showing items and total clearly visible<br>• Status bars displaying upload/download progress<br>• Bad example: Hidden menus where users can't find important features"

    "explanation": "Familiarity means using designs that match what users already know from the real world or other apps.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Users expect things to work like they've seen before. When you break these expectations, users get confused and need more time to learn.<br><br><strong>Example:</strong><br>• Trash can icon for delete—everyone knows you throw trash away<br>• Shopping cart icon in online stores—matches real shopping<br>• Bad example: Snapchat's swipe navigation confused users because it didn't match other apps"

    "explanation": "Navigation means users should always know their location in the system and how to move around. Provide clear paths and wayfinding.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Lost users become frustrated and abandon tasks.

    "explanation": "Constraints limit what users can do to prevent mistakes before they happen.

Users don't need to remember rules when the design prevents mistakes.<br><br><strong>Example:</strong><br>• Calendar picker won't let you pick February 30th—impossible date<br>• Number fields only accept numbers, not letters<br>• Bad example: Letting users type any date format, then showing an error after they submit"

    "explanation": "Control means users feel in charge and can decide when, how, and if they do something. Don't force users down a path.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Users hate feeling trapped or forced. They need to control the pace and make choices themselves.<br><br><strong>Example:</strong><br>• Skip intro button—users choose if they watch<br>• Video player controls (play, pause, rewind)—users control it<br>• Bad example: Auto-playing videos that can't be paused—users feel forced to watch"
