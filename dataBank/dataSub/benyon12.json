    "explanation": "Consistency means that similar elements should look similar and behave in predictable, uniform ways throughout an interface. When users learn one interaction pattern, it should transfer to other similar contexts without relearning.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Consistency reduces cognitive load—users don't need to think about every interaction because learned patterns apply everywhere. Inconsistency forces users to relearn behaviors, increases errors, and creates frustration.<br><br><strong>Example:</strong> In Microsoft Office, the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+S saves documents across Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. The File menu is always in the top-left corner. Bold buttons look the same everywhere. This consistency lets users transfer knowledge between applications seamlessly. Contrast this with inconsistent designs where Submit is a button on one page but a link on another, or where deletion requires confirmation sometimes but not others—users become confused and make mistakes.",

    "answer": "Consider Users' Resources",
    "explanation": "Consider Users Resources' means designing with awareness that users have limited attention, memory, physical capability, and time. Good design minimizes unnecessary mental and physical workload.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Users don't have infinite patience or mental energy. Systems that demand excessive scrolling, complex memorization, or repetitive actions cause fatigue, errors, and abandonment. Respecting users' resources makes interfaces feel effortless.<br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Amazons1-Click orderingrespects users cognitive resources by storing payment and shipping details, eliminating repetitive form-filling. Autocomplete in search bars reduces typing effort. Netflix auto-playing the next episode respects decision fatigue. Poor design: requiring users to re-enter credit card details for every purchase, or forcing them to remember complex 16-character passwords without showing a reveal password option."

    "explanation": "Familiarity leverages users' existing knowledge from the real world and prior experiences with similar systems. Familiar interfaces feel intuitive because they match mental models users already possess.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Users approach new systems with expectations based on past experiences. Violating these expectations creates confusion and slows learning. Familiar designs allow instant understanding with minimal instruction.<br><br><strong>Example:</strong> The trash can or recycle bin icon for deletion is familiar because it matches the real-world metaphor of throwing away unwanted items. Shopping carts in e-commerce match physical shopping experiences. Volume controls using sliders match physical knobs. When Snapchat introduced unconventional navigation (swipe left/right/down for different features), users were confused because it violated familiar app patterns—their mental models didn't transfer."

    "answer": "Responsiveness",
    "explanation": "Responsiveness means the system reacts quickly and appropriately to user actions, providing timely confirmation that input was received and processing is happening.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Slow or absent responses create uncertainty ('Did my click register?'), leading users to repeat actions, causing errors or frustration. Users judge system quality partly by response speed—delays feel like the system is broken.<br><br><strong>Example:</strong> When you click a button, it should visually respond instantly (change color, show pressed state) even if backend processing takes longer. Loading spinners communicate that the system is working. Google Search shows results in milliseconds. Poor responsiveness: clicking Submit on a form and seeing nothing happen for 5 seconds—users click again, creating duplicate submissions. Responsive design acknowledges every action immediately, even if the full result takes time."

    "explanation": "Constraints strategically limit user actions to prevent errors before they occur. By making invalid or dangerous actions impossible or difficult, constraints guide users toward correct behavior.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Preventing errors is better than allowing them and requiring recovery. Constraints reduce cognitive load—users don't need to remember complex rules because the interface enforces them physically.<br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Date picker calendars constrain input to valid dates—you can't select February 30th. Form fields that only accept numbers prevent text input. A Submit button disabled until all required fields are filled prevents incomplete submissions. USB connectors are physically asymmetric—they only fit one way. ATMs retain your card until you take your cash, preventing you from forgetting it. Poor constraint: allowing users to type any format into a date field, then showing an error message after submission."

    "explanation": "User Control means users should feel they are in charge of the system, able to initiate actions, make decisions, and interrupt or reverse processes. Systems should respond to user intentions, not impose their own agenda.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Loss of control creates anxiety and frustration. When systems force actions or prevent users from stopping unwanted processes, users feel helpless. Control creates confidence and trust.<br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Video players let users pause, skip, adjust volume, and change speed—they control the experience. Websites with Skip intro buttons respect user control. Browser Back buttons let users reverse navigation mistakes. Poor control: auto-playing videos with hidden controls, websites that hijack scrolling behavior, forced tutorials that can't be skipped, systems that prevent copy-pasting into password fields, or pop-ups that are hard to close."

Obvious interfaces feel intuitive and discoverable—users immediately understand what actions are possible and how to perform them.<br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Buttons that look clickable (raised, colored, with hover effects). Door handles that clearly show whether to push or pull. Underlined blue text signals a hyperlink. Sliders have draggable handles. Icons like magnifying glass (search) or house (home) are universally recognized. Poor obviousness: flat design where buttons look like decoration, links that don't look clickable, hidden navigation in hamburger menus that users don't discover, or interfaces where interactive and static elements look identical."

Direct interfaces let users manipulate objects and see results immediately, creating a feeling of direct engagement rather than issuing commands through intermediaries.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Indirect interactions feel clunky and abstract, requiring users to translate intentions into system commands. Direct manipulation feels natural and intuitive—users operate on objects directly, reducing cognitive translation.<br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Touchscreens where you drag icons directly with your finger vs. using a mouse cursor. Slider controls you manipulate directly vs. typing numbers into fields. Drag-and-drop file management vs. cut/paste commands. Drawing apps where stylus movements instantly appear as marks. Poor directness: complex command-line interfaces requiring memorized syntax, multi-step wizards for simple tasks, or modal dialogs that interrupt flow and require navigating through layers of indirection to accomplish simple actions."

YouTube displays buffer progress while videos load. File transfers show speed and time remaining. Even indeterminate spinners ('loading...') provide feedback that processing is happening.
