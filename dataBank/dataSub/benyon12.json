      "Consistency",
      "Constraints"
    ],
    "answerIndex": 2,
    "answer": "Consistency",
    "explanation": "Consistency means similar things should look and act the same way everywhere in your interface. When users learn how to do something once, it should work the same way in other places.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Users don't need to relearn things when everything is consistent. If things look similar but act differently, users get confused and make mistakes.<br><br><strong>Example:</strong><br>• In Microsoft Office, Ctrl+S saves your work in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint—always the same<br>• The Bold button looks identical across all apps<br>• Bad example: A Submit button on one page, but a Submit link on another page—users don't know what to expect",

    "explanation": "Consider Users' Resources means users have limited energy, time, and memory. Don't make them work harder than needed.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Users get tired easily. Too much scrolling, typing, or remembering things makes them frustrated and more likely to quit.<br><br><strong>Example:</strong><br>• Amazon's 1-Click ordering saves your payment info so you don't retype it every time<br>• Google autocomplete finishes your searches so you type less<br>• Bad example: Making users enter their credit card for every purchase"

When you break these expectations, users get confused and need more time to learn.<br><br><strong>Example:</strong><br>• Trash can icon for delete—everyone knows you throw trash away<br>• Shopping cart icon in online stores—matches real shopping<br>• Bad example: Snapchat's swipe navigation confused users because it didn't match other apps"
