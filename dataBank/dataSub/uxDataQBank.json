      "They require less maintenance"
    ],
    "answerIndex": 1,
    "answer": "They are easier to use",
    "explanation": "The Aesthetic-Usability Effect states that users perceive aesthetically pleasing designs as easier to use, even before they actually learn how to use them. A clean and visually appealing interface can create a positive first impression and increase user tolerance for minor usability issues.<br><br><br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Apple's iOS interface with its clean typography, consistent spacing, and smooth animations makes users feel the system is intuitive and easy to use, even before they explore all features. Users are more forgiving of minor navigation issues when the overall design looks polished."

    ],
    "answerIndex": 1,
    "answer": "Less than 400ms",
    "explanation": "The Doherty Threshold states that productivity increases when a computer and its user interact at a pace that ensures neither has to wait on the other. This threshold is achieved when system response time is less than 400ms, keeping users engaged and in flow.<br><br><br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Google Search displays results almost instantly as you type (typically under 200ms), keeping you engaged. Similarly, Instagram shows skeleton loaders immediately when opening the app, making the 400ms loading time feel fast and maintaining user attention."

    ],
    "answerIndex": 1,
    "answer": "Time depends on target size and distance",
    "explanation": "Fitts's Law states that the time required to move to a target area is a function of the distance to the target divided by the size of the target. In UX design, this means making interactive elements larger and placing them closer to where users need them improves usability.<br><br><br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Mobile apps place primary action buttons (like Send or Next) large and at the bottom of the screen where thumbs naturally rest. iOS's back button is positioned at the top-left corner—easy to reach—and is large enough to tap quickly without precision."

    "answer": "Decision time increases",
    "explanation": "Hick's Law states that the time it takes to make a decision increases logarithmically with the number of choices available. To improve UX, designers should reduce cognitive load by grouping options into categories and limiting the number of choices presented at once.<br><br><br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Netflix groups thousands of shows into categories (Action, Comedy, Documentaries) rather than showing everything at once. A restaurant menu with 5 clearly defined sections helps diners decide faster than a menu with 50 ungrouped items."

    ],
    "answerIndex": 1,
    "answer": "Users expect your site to work like other sites they know",
    "explanation": "Jakob's Law states that users spend most of their time on other sites, so they prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. This means designers should leverage existing mental models and familiar patterns rather than reinventing common interactions.<br><br><br><br><strong>Example:</strong> E-commerce sites consistently place shopping carts in the top-right corner because that's where Amazon put it and users now expect it there. Login buttons typically appear in the top-right, and hamburger menus (☰) universally mean navigation menu because users learned these patterns elsewhere."

    "answerIndex": 1,
    "answer": "A clearly defined boundary",
    "explanation": "The Law of Common Region is a Gestalt principle stating that elements are perceived as part of a group if they are located within the same closed region or boundary. This can be achieved through backgrounds, borders, or containers that visually separate groups of content.<br><br><br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Airbnb uses card containers with subtle borders to group each property listing (image, price, location, rating) together. Pricing tables use boxes with different background colors to separate Basic, Pro, and Enterprise plans into distinct regions."

    "answerIndex": 0,
    "answer": "People perceive complex patterns as simple shapes",
    "explanation": "The Law of Prägnanz states that people will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images in the simplest form possible. Our brains naturally reduce complexity and see objects in their most basic, stable form. This principle guides designers to create clean, simple interfaces.<br><br><br><br><strong>Example:</strong> The Olympic rings logo appears as five overlapping circles, not complex curved shapes. The FedEx logo contains an arrow in negative space, but our brains first see it as simple letters. App icons use basic geometric shapes (circles, squares, triangles) because they're instantly recognizable."

    "answerIndex": 1,
    "answer": "Part of a single group",
    "explanation": "The Law of Proximity is a Gestalt principle stating that objects that are near or close to each other tend to be grouped together. Designers use spacing strategically to show relationships between elements - related items are placed closer together while unrelated items are separated.<br><br><br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Form labels placed directly above their input fields (with minimal spacing) clearly show which label belongs to which field. In navigation menus, items within a category are grouped closely together, while different categories have larger gaps between them."

    ],
    "answerIndex": 0,
    "answer": "Having the same function or being related",
    "explanation": "The Law of Similarity is a Gestalt principle stating that elements that share similar visual characteristics (color, shape, size, orientation, etc.) are perceived as being more related than elements that are dissimilar. This helps users quickly identify patterns and understand interface organization.<br><br><br><br><strong>Example:</strong> All clickable buttons in an app use the same blue color, while non-interactive text is gray—users instantly know what's clickable. In a calendar app, all past events are shown in light gray, current events in bold black, making it easy to distinguish time periods at a glance."

    "answerIndex": 1,
    "answer": "Elements connected by uniform visual properties are seen as more related",
    "explanation": "The Law of Uniform Connectedness states that elements that are visually connected (through lines, colors, or other uniform properties) are perceived as more related than elements without connections. This is one of the strongest grouping principles in visual perception.<br><br><br><br><strong>Example:</strong> A progress bar visually connects numbered steps (1→2→3→4) in a checkout process with a continuous line, showing they're part of one journey. Timeline visualizations use lines connecting events to show their relationships and sequence."

    "answer": "People can hold about 7 (±2) items in working memory",
    "explanation": "Miller's Law states that the average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory. This principle guides designers to chunk information into smaller groups, limit navigation items, and avoid overwhelming users with too many choices at once.<br><br><br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Phone numbers are formatted as 555-123-4567 (three chunks) instead of 5551234567 (one long number).

    "answerIndex": 1,
    "answer": "The simplest solution is usually the best",
    "explanation": "Occam's Razor states that among competing solutions, the simplest one is usually the best. In UX design, this means removing unnecessary elements, simplifying interactions, and focusing on essential features. Complexity should only be added when it serves a clear purpose.<br><br><br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Google's homepage has just a search box and logo—nothing else. WhatsApp focuses on messaging without unnecessary social features. The Sign in with Google button reduces login from multiple form fields to one click."

    "answer": "80% of effects come from 20% of causes",
    "explanation": "The Pareto Principle states that roughly 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. In UX, this means 80% of users typically use 20% of features. Designers should identify and optimize these key features while keeping less-used features accessible but not prominent.<br><br><br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Microsoft discovered that fixing the top 20% of reported bugs would eliminate 80% of errors. In most apps, users spend 80% of their time using just 20% of features—search, main navigation, and core actions deserve the most design attention."

    "explanation": "Parkinson's Law states that work expands to fill the time available for its completion. In UX, this principle suggests that giving users too much time or too many options can lead to overthinking and decision paralysis. Setting appropriate constraints and deadlines can actually improve productivity and decision-making.<br><br><br><br><strong>Example:</strong> E-commerce sites use countdown timers ('Sale ends in 2 hours!') to create urgency and prevent endless browsing.

    "explanation": "The Peak-End Rule states that people judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak (most intense point) and at its end, rather than the average of every moment. Designers should focus on creating memorable peak moments and ensuring smooth, positive endings to user journeys.<br><br><br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Uber shows a detailed trip summary and thanks message at the end of rides.

    "explanation": "Postel's Law states: 'Be liberal in what you accept from others, and conservative in what you send.' In UX, this means systems should be flexible with user input (accepting various formats, forgiving errors) while providing clear, consistent output. This reduces user frustration and improves usability.<br><br><br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Phone number fields accept multiple formats (555-1234, (555) 1234, 555.1234, 5551234) but always display consistently.

    "explanation": "The Serial Position Effect shows that users tend to remember the first items (primacy effect) and last items (recency effect) in a series best, while items in the middle are less memorable. Designers should place important information at the beginning and end of lists or sequences.<br><br><br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Restaurant menus place high-profit items first and last on the menu. Navigation menus put the most important links (Home, Account) at the start and end. Terms of service agreements highlight key points at the beginning and end where users are most likely to read."

    "answer": "Every system has inherent complexity that cannot be removed, only moved",
    "explanation": "Tesler's Law states that for any system there is a certain amount of complexity that cannot be reduced, only shifted. Designers must decide whether to handle complexity on the users side or the systems side. Good design often means taking on complexity to make things simpler for users.<br><br><br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Email spam filtering handles complexity behind the scenes (analyzing patterns, maintaining blacklists) so users just see a clean inbox.
