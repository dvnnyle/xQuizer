    "law": "Aesthetic Usability Effect",
    "description": "Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that’s more usable. Visually pleasing design can mask usability problems and lead users to believe the design works better.",
    "example": "People are more tolerant of minor usability issues when the design of a product or service is aesthetically pleasing. A beautiful interface can make users feel the product is easier to use, even if it’s not.",

      "An aesthetically pleasing design creates a positive response in people’s brains and leads them to believe the design actually works better.",
      "People are more tolerant of minor usability issues when the design of a product or service is aesthetically pleasing.",
      "Visually pleasing design can mask usability problems and prevent issues from being discovered during usability testing."
    ],
    "origins": "The aesthetic-usability effect was first studied in the field of human–computer interaction in 1995. Researchers Masaaki Kurosu and Kaori Kashimura from the Hitachi Design Center tested 26 variations of an ATM UI, asking the 252 study participants to rate each design on ease of use, as well as aesthetic appeal. They found a stronger correlation between the participants’ ratings of aesthetic appeal and perceived ease of use than the correlation between their ratings of aesthetic appeal and actual ease of use. Kurosu and Kashimura concluded that users are strongly influenced by the aesthetics of any given interface, even when they try to evaluate the underlying functionality of the system."

    "origins": "In 1982 Walter J. Doherty and Ahrvind J. Thadani published, in the IBM Systems Journal, a research paper that set the requirement for computer response time to be 400 milliseconds, not 2,000 (2 seconds) which had been the previous standard. When a human being’s command was executed and returned an answer in under 400 milliseconds, it was deemed to exceed the Doherty threshold, and use of such applications were deemed to be addicting to users."
