    "answerIndex": 0,
    "answer": "Aesthetic-Usability Effect",
    "explanation": "The Aesthetic-Usability Effect states that users perceive aesthetically pleasing designs as easier to use, even before they learn how to actually use them. <br><br><strong>Example:</strong> A clean, modern interface with good typography and spacing makes users feel more confident about using an app, even if they haven't explored its features yet."

    "options": [
      "Bigger targets are easier to click",
      "More choices lead to slower decisions",
      "People remember the first and last items best",
      "Systems should respond within 400ms"
    ],
    "answerIndex": 1,
    "answer": "More choices lead to slower decisions",
    "explanation": "Hick's Law states that decision time increases with the number of choices available. Designers should limit options to reduce cognitive load. <br><br><strong>Example:</strong> A restaurant menu with 5 categories is easier to navigate than one with 20 categories. Netflix groups content into genres to avoid overwhelming users."

      "Tesler's Law"
    ],
    "answerIndex": 1,
    "answer": "Fitts's Law",
    "explanation": "Fitts's Law states that the time to reach a target depends on its size and distance. Larger, closer targets are easier and faster to interact with. <br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Mobile apps make primary action buttons large and positioned at thumb-friendly locations. Small close buttons in the corner are harder to tap."

    "answerIndex": 2,
    "answer": "Miller's Law",
    "explanation": "Miller's Law states that the average person can hold about 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory at once. <br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Phone numbers are chunked into groups (555-123-4567), and navigation menus typically have 5-7 main items. Credit card numbers are shown in 4-digit groups."

      "Aesthetic-Usability Effect"
    ],
    "answerIndex": 0,
    "answer": "Jakob's Law",
    "explanation": "Jakob's Law states that users spend most of their time on other sites, so they prefer your site to work the same way as sites they already know. <br><br><strong>Example:</strong> E-commerce sites put shopping carts in the top-right corner and use familiar checkout flows because that's what users expect from Amazon and other major retailers."

      "Law of Common Region"
    ],
    "answerIndex": 1,
    "answer": "Law of Proximity",
    "explanation": "The Law of Proximity states that objects near each other tend to be grouped together in perception. <br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Form labels placed directly above their input fields show they belong together. Product images positioned close to their prices indicate the relationship between them."

      "Law of Prägnanz"
    ],
    "answerIndex": 2,
    "answer": "Law of Similarity",
    "explanation": "The Law of Similarity states that elements with similar visual characteristics are perceived as being more related than dissimilar elements. <br><br><strong>Example:</strong> All buttons with the same blue color are understood as clickable actions, while gray text indicates non-interactive labels. Links share the same underline style."

    "answerIndex": 1,
    "answer": "Law of Common Region",
    "explanation": "The Law of Common Region states that elements within a clearly defined boundary are perceived as part of a group. <br><br><strong>Example:</strong> A card container with a border groups related information together. Pricing tables use boxes to separate different plan tiers."

    "answer": "Law of Uniform Connectedness",
    "explanation": "The Law of Uniform Connectedness states that elements visually connected through lines, colors, or other properties are perceived as more related. <br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Progress bars connect steps in a checkout process. Connected dots in a timeline show the flow of events."

    "answerIndex": 1,
    "answer": "Law of Prägnanz",
    "explanation": "The Law of Prägnanz (Good Figure) states that people perceive ambiguous or complex images in their simplest, most stable form. <br><br><strong>Example:</strong> The Olympic rings are seen as overlapping circles, not complex curved shapes. Logos use simple geometric forms that are easy to recognize and remember."

    "answerIndex": 1,
    "answer": "Tesler's Law",
    "explanation": "Tesler's Law (Law of Conservation of Complexity) states that every system has inherent complexity that cannot be removed, only shifted between the user and the system. <br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Email apps handle spam filtering complexity behind the scenes so users don't have to. Smart defaults reduce user choices but require more system intelligence."

    "answer": "Pareto Principle",
    "explanation": "The Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule) states that roughly 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. In UX, 80% of users typically use 20% of features. <br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Microsoft found that 80% of errors come from 20% of bugs. Focus on optimizing the most-used features like search, checkout, and navigation rather than rarely-used advanced settings."

    "explanation": "Parkinson's Law states that work expands to fill the time available for its completion. Setting constraints can improve productivity and decision-making. <br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Limited-time offers create urgency. Twitter's character limit forces concise communication. Countdown timers in checkout flows reduce cart abandonment."

    "answer": "Postel's Law",
    "explanation": "Postel's Law (Robustness Principle) states: Be liberal in what you accept from others, and conservative in what you send. Systems should be flexible with input but provide consistent output. <br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Search accepts misspellings, different formats, and variations. Phone number inputs accept various formats (555-1234, 555 1234, 5551234) but display consistently."

    "answer": "Serial Position Effect",
    "explanation": "The Serial Position Effect shows that users remember the first items (primacy) and last items (recency) in a series best, while middle items are less memorable. <br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Place important navigation items at the start and end of menus.

    "explanation": "The Von Restorff Effect (Isolation Effect) states that when multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs is most likely to be remembered. <br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Call-to-action buttons use bright colors (green Sign Up among gray buttons).
