    "description": "Users perceive aesthetically pleasing design as easier to use.",
    "principle": "A clean interface feels more usable even before the user learns it.",
    "practice": "Apple's iOS uses elegant typography, smooth animations, and clean layouts—making users feel the system is more intuitive and reliable even before mastering all features.",
    "explanation": "The Aesthetic-Usability Effect states that users perceive aesthetically pleasing designs as easier to use, even before they learn how to actually use them. <br><br><strong>Example:</strong> A clean, modern interface with good typography and spacing makes users feel more confident about using an app, even if they haven't explored its features yet."
