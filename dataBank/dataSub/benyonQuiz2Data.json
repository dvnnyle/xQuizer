    "answer": "Consistency",
    "description": "Similar elements should look similar and behave in predictable, uniform ways throughout an interface. When users learn one interaction pattern, it should transfer to other similar contexts.",
    "principle": "Consistency reduces cognitive load by allowing learned patterns to transfer across contexts.",
    "practice": "Microsoft Office uses Ctrl+S to save across all applications. The File menu is always in the same location. Bold buttons look identical everywhere. This lets users transfer knowledge seamlessly between Word, Excel, and PowerPoint."

    "description": "Strategically limit user actions to prevent errors before they occur. By making invalid or dangerous actions impossible or difficult, constraints guide users toward correct behavior.",
    "principle": "Preventing errors is better than allowing them and requiring recovery.",
    "practice": "Date picker calendars prevent selecting invalid dates like February 30th. Form fields that only accept numbers reject text input. USB connectors are physically asymmetric—they only fit one way."
