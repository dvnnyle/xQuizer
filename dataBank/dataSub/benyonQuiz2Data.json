    "description": "Users should be able to see what the system is doing, what state it is in, and what alternatives and options are available. Important information should be visible and obvious.",
    "principle": "Making system state visible helps users understand what's happening and what they can do next.",

    "answer": "Consistency",
    "description": "Similar elements should look similar and behave in predictable, uniform ways throughout an interface. When users learn one interaction pattern, it should transfer to other similar contexts.",
    "principle": "Consistency reduces cognitive load by allowing learned patterns to transfer across contexts.",
    "practice": "Microsoft Office uses Ctrl+S to save across all applications. The File menu is always in the same location. Bold buttons look identical everywhere. This lets users transfer knowledge seamlessly between Word, Excel, and PowerPoint."

    "description": "Users should feel they are in charge of the system, able to initiate actions, make decisions, and interrupt or reverse processes. Systems should respond to user intentions, not impose their own agenda.",
    "principle": "Loss of control creates anxiety and frustration.",
